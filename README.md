# Wellbeing

No-nonsense command to remind you to take care of yourself.

This terminal utility allows you to setup a timer to remind
you to drink water, stretch, check your posture, or of a custom
reminder.

```bash
wellbeing [--water=<every> --stretch=<every> --posture=<every>] [(--custom=<every> [--message=<msg>])]
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeevmm/wellbeing
